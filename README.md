# Camgrabber

Saves images from an url in a specific interval and renders a daily time lapse video from the images. Weather data will be included into each image (and of course the video).

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.6
- ffmepg
- Graphviz

## Installation (Debian/Ubuntu Linux)

- Install some packages
  `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg graphviz python3 python3-venv`
- Clone this repository
  `git clone https://github.com/elpatron68/camgrabber.git`
- Create Python Virtual Environment
  `cd camgrabber && python3 -m venv venv`
- Activate the Virtual Environment
  `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install Python requirements
  `pip install wheel`
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Download the needed font from http://www.911fonts.com/font/download_MicrosoftSansSerifRegular_6457.htm and save it as `MicrosoftSansSerifRegular.ttf` in the same directory as `main.py`

## Start

To obtain weather data, you need to have a (free) API key from https://openweathermap.org/api. Create an account, log in and generate a key: https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys.

Before the first start: Edit `main.py` and change values in the settings section to your needs.

_Example settings_

```
"""
Change setting below!
"""
URL = 'https://www.yacht-club-norden.de/MOBOTIX/nu.jpg'
INTERVAL = 15
# Use %i for an incrementing number
FILENAME = 'ycn-%i.jpg'
# Search your place on https://openweathermap.org and use the number in the URL (eg. https://openweathermap.org/city/2862041 -> 2862041)
OPENWEATEHR_ID = '2862041'
OPENWEATHER_APIKEY = '<insert your openweathermap api key here>'
# You can get your location from https://maps.google.com. See URL after selecting a location or right click and select "WhatÂ´s here?"
LAT = '53.624721 N'
LON = '7.153373 E'
```

### Manual start

`source venv/bin/activate`
`python main.py`

### Run permanently with Supervisor

- Install _Supervisor_: `sudo apt-get install -y supervisor`
- Edit the configuration file:
    `sudo nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/camgrabber.conf`
    ```
    [program:camgrabber]
    directory=/home/ubuntu/camgrabber
    command=/home/ubuntu/camgrabber/venv/bin/python main.py
    autostart=true
    autorestart=true
    startretries=10
    startsecs=10
    stopwaitsecs=5
    user=ubuntu
    stdout_logfile=/home/ubuntu/camgrabber/log/camgrabber.stdout.log
    stdout_logfile_maxbytes=100000
    stderr_logfile=/home/ubuntu/camgrabber/log/camgrabber.stderr.log
    stderr_logfile_maxbytes=100000
    ```
    (Change `directory`, `command` and `user`)
- Reread and update the configuration: `sudo supervisorctl reread && sudo supervisorctl update`
- Check status: `sudo supervisorctl status`
